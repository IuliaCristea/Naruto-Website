			<p>One day, in Konoha, the <strong>Nine-Tails Demon Fox</strong> was summoned in the village to destroy it. The Fourth Hokage, <em>Minato Namikaze</em>, tried to lead it away from the village with the help of the villagers, during his child birth, but they all failed, because kyubi was too strong.</p>  
			<p>He, then, decided to seal it's power in his son believing that one day Naruto will manage to use that enormous chakra to bring peace in the Shinobi world. Hearing that, kyubi tried to kill Naruto, but the <em>love</em> of his parents was stronger and they run right intro kyubi's claws, leaving their son their dream of peace and their trust.</p>
			<p>During his childhood Naruto was a lonely child, willing to be acknowledged and wondering why he has no parents. He was feared by the villagers because of the demon fox inside him and they isolated him.</p>
			<p>Things changed when he entered the Ninja Academy. He was always noisy and bustling, trying to get everyone's attention, but the kids only made fun of him.</p>
			<p>But he managed to make a lot of friends in the academy and also a rival, Sasuke Uchiha, and thought of him as a brother he never had.</p>
			<p>Sooner or later, Sasuke left the village in order to train with <strong>Orochimaru</strong>, one of the Legendary 3 Sanin of The Leaf, to get power to kill his brother, Itachi.</p>
			<p>Naruto <i>made a promise</i> to Sakura to bring Sasuke back to the village and here starts his journey: Naruto went several times to search for Sasuke, but he never succeeded. In the mean time, Naruto fought with many enemies, inluding The Akatsuki, an evil organization who were collecting Tailed Beasts to put the Shinobi world under an infinite genjutsu.</p>
			<p>After Naruto defeated Akatsuki and becoming the hero of the village, Tobi started the Fourth Great Ninja War againts all Five Great Nations forcing them to cooperate for the first time in history. But the head of the war was <strong>Madara Uchiha</strong>, whose plan was to become the strongest ninja in the world and put it under genjutsu.</p>
			<p>While everybody was trapped under the Infinite Tsukuyomi, Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Kakashi and Obito manage to escape. Madara turned into <em>Kaguya Otsutsuki</em>, the creator of shinobi, the goddess who was sealed into the moon by her sons. After long and exhausting battles, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura sealed her away again, along with her third son, Zetsu, putting an end to the war. </p>
			<p>But Sasuke had a different view of the world and wanted to execute all five Kage along with Naruto in order to become Hokage and change the world. Naruto couldn't allow this to happen and they fought day and night until all their strength faded and Sasuke realized that altering the bonds between people cannot lead to world peace.</p>
			<p>And so, Naruto protected the Shinobi world and became a hero. He fulfilled his dream and became the Seventh Hokage of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.</p>
			<p>Now he finally has his <i>family</i> that he wanted so much, along with Hinata, Boruto and Himawary. </p>
